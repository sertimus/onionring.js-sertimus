// Modifications by Sertimus (https://sertimus.xyz/), including the addition of onionring-functions.js

/*  One extra thing to note is that the order in which you load the scripts are very important. It should be as follows:
    1) onionring-functions    
    2) onionring-variables
    3) onionring-widget, onionring-index 
    
    Failure to follow this script order may result in weird errors. */
